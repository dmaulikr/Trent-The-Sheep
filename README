This is a game based on the tutorial at
http://www.raywenderlich.com/352/how-to-make-a-simple-iphone-game-with-cocos2d-tutorial
and looking at the sample code which is different than the code of the tutorial.
I also will implement a permutation class and a combination class so I can use this for a class project.
